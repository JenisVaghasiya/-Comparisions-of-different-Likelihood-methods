Implemented and compared Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Pseudo Likelihood, and Quasi Likelihood methods across linear regression, generalized linear models, and correlated data models using simulated and real-world datasets. Assessed accuracy, bias, computational efficiency, and robustness to model misspecification through extensive simulations. Summarized findings in a report with guidelines for selecting the optimal likelihood approach based on data characteristics and computational constraints.
